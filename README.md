### I think you need to call the exterminator. There's a kitty in your computer...



## What is *KNMP_win*?
KNMP, or kitty noise media player for windows, is a harmless and funny program which plays a super irritating cat noise in the background in a hidden media player. 

## Is that it?
No, of course not! the program also:

- loops the noise at an 1/2 hour rate (and no, not exactly an hour, the time constantly changes to reduce predictability)
- auto-runs off of a USB flash drive(sadly this feature doesn't work on Win7+)
- for non-auto-run compatible systems, the file can be copied onto the computer, and will execute on startup.
- adjusts the computer's volume right before playing the noise and resets it afterwards(not implemented yet)
- is easy, but not too straightforward to stop
- annoys people
- doesn't harm any computers (unless your computer has some serious issues)
